EBACALC is a web-based calculator that differ from conventional alcohol calculators by telling how often you can re-dose. EBACALC is a portmanteau of the terms <em>EBAC</em> (an abbreviation of <em>Estimated Blood Alcohol Content</em>) anc <em>Calc.</em> (an abbreviation of <em>calculator</em>), it is written by David Hedlund. EBACALC presents only <em>moderate</em> alcohol consumption for your sex and weight to help you stay away or quit binge drinking. After enough training with this tool it is likely that you don't have to use it since you can learn the psychology to drink in moderate; This is called <em>state-dependent learning</em>. A good advice is to replace the extra glasses of alcoholic beverages for social reasons with with water.

EBACALC revealed that the number of minutes for a quarter of a drink (without carbonic acid) to be metabolized is equal to the amount mg/dL BAC for males, and the amount mg/dL BAC x 1.1 for females: For example, 40 mL (about 1.35 oz.) of a 40% ABV (alcohol by volume) spirit which is equal to 16 mL (about .54 oz.) alcohol gives in a body weight of 80 kg (176 lb.), 27 mg/dL (0.027%) EBAC (estimated blood alcohol content) in males, and 34 mg/dL (0.034%) EBAC in females. So 1/4th of this dose (10 mL or .34 oz.) is metabolized in 27 minutes and 30 minutes, for males and females respectively.
